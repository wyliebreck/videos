# Designing multimedia learning material

{{}}
{{This presentation is about designing multimedia learning material.}}
{{Much of the learning material that we make, consists mostly of words.}}
{{But a large amount of research over the past 30 years, has shown that learning material is more effective if we use images as well, images that illustrate what our words are saying.}}
{{That is, learning material is more effective if it's multimedia, containing not just words, but also images.}}
{{In this presentation, I'll explain how to design multimedia learning material, in accordance with what the research has found.}}

# Multimedia material

{{Multimedia material is material that uses both words and images.}}
{{The words might be written, or spoken, or both.}}
{{And the images might be static, or dynamic, or both.}}
{{What makes it multimedia is that it uses both words and images.}}
{{This presentation uses words. But it hasn't yet used any images. So it's not yet multimedia.}}
{{Even though its words are both written and spoken, it's not multimedia, because it's all just words, and no images.}}

<img src="chad.png" style="height:15em;width:auto;border-radius:100%">

{{Now it uses an image as well. So now it's multimedia.}}
{{Multimedia material can be used for a variety of purposes. But in this presentation, I focus just on using it for learning.}}

# 12 principles

{{I'll be presenting 12 principles about multimedia learning material.}}
{{The principles are supported by both experiment and theory.}}

- Supported by experiment
  {{They're supported by experiment, in the sense that they've been tested in multiple randomised controlled experiments, which have shown effects that are statistically significant, and large.}}

- Supported by theory
  {{They're supported by theory, in the sense that they can be explained by well-established theories in psychology and cognitive science.}}

Richard Mayer

{{One of the main people in the area is Richard Mayer, and the principles are sometimes called "Mayer's principles of multimedia learning".}}

# Learning from multimedia material

{{To understand Mayer's principles, it helps to know how we learn from multimedia material.}}

1. We select
   {{First, we select words and images in the material to attend to}}

2. We organise
   {{Second, we organise those words and images into a coherent thought}}

3. We integrate
   {{Third, we integrate and store that thought with what we already know}}

Using our working memory
{{We do all of this using our working memory.}}

---

# Working memory is extremely limited

{{A key fact about working memory, is that it's extremely limited. We can only process a few items at a time, and they're quickly lost once we stop processing them.}}
{{Because of this, our working memory can easily become overloaded. And when that happens, we stop learning.}}
{{Mayer's principles tell us how to design multimedia learning material, in a way that prevents it from overloading working memory.}}

---

# Working memory has two channels

<div style="position:relative;margin-top:1em;padding:0 12em">
  {{A second key fact about working memory, is that it has two channels, which operate in parallel.}}
  <div style="padding:2em;border:medium gray solid">Visual channel</div>
  {{We have a visual channel, in which we process images}}
  <div style="padding:2em;border:medium gray solid;border-top:none">Auditory channel</div>
  {{And we have an auditory channel, in which we process sounds}}
  {{Multimedia material allows us to use both channels at the same time, which is why it's so good for learning.}}
  <div style="position:absolute;left:0;width:12em;top:2em;text-align:right;">Images &rarr;</div>
  {{Images are processed in the visual channel.}}
  <div style="position:absolute;left:0;width:12em;top:7.5em;text-align:right;">Spoken words &rarr;</div>
  {{Spoken words are processed in the auditory channel.}}
  {{Because they're processed in different channels, images and spoken words can be processed at the same time.}}
  {{Written words are more demanding.}}
  <div style="position:absolute;left:0;width:12em;top:3em;text-align:right;"><b>Written words</b> &rarr;</div>
  {{Because we need to read them, written words are processed in the visual channel.}}
  <div style="position:absolute;left:0;width:12em;top:6.5em;text-align:right;"><b>Written words</b> &rarr;</div>
  {{But reading them turns them into sounds, made by our inner voice, which are processed in the auditory channel.}}
  {{So written words are processed in both the visual and auditory channels, which makes them more demanding on working memory.}}
  {{Because they're processed in the visual channel, they can interfere with our processing of images.}}
  {{And because they're processed in the auditory channel, they can interfere with our processing of spoken words.}}
  {{We'll see the significance of this shortly.}}
</div>

{{With this understanding of working memory, and its two channels, we're ready for the 12 principles.}}

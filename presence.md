# Teacher presence<br>in UNSW Online courses

{{Hi. Thanks for coming, to our session about teacher presence in UNSW Online courses.}}
{{We'll be sharing what we've learned about teacher presence over the past three years, since we launched our first fully-online programs.}}

# Does your presence matter?

{{You might be wondering whether your presence matters, given that UNSW Online courses are fully self-contained, designed for students to work through at their own pace.}}
{{It's true, some students will be quite happy by themselves.}}
{{But others will need your help, and some will need quite a lot.}}
{{Even students who don't need your help, will still like to know that you're there and available.}}

{{Here's a chart that shows there's a correlation, between how satisfied our students have been with their teachers each hexamester (the blue line), and how satisfied they've been with their courses (the orange line).}}
{{Notice that the orange line goes up and down in step with the blue line.}}
{{Perhaps this shows just how much your presence matters.}}

# Three key things

{{To make your presence felt, there are three key things you can do.}}

1. Announce weekly
  {{One. Announce weekly}}

2. Respond quickly
  {{Two. Respond quickly}}

3. Have webinars
  {{Three. Have webinars}}

{{We'll consider each of these in turn.}}

# First key thing:<br>Announce weekly

{{The first key thing you can do is to announce weekly.}}
{{If you're the course convenor, you should post an announcement at the beginning of each week.}}
{{This lets the students know that you're there, and that you're thinking of them.}}
{{It doesn't matter so much what you say - just saying something is the main thing.}}
{{But here are some things that are good to include.}}

- Welcome them to the week
  {{First, welcome them to the week.}}
  {{This can be as simple as saying "Hi", and reminding them what week it is.}}

- Give some encouragement
  {{Second, give some encouragement.}}
  {{If they did well on something during the previous week, let them know.}}

- Remind them of the week's tasks
  {{Third, remind them of the week's tasks.}}
  {{If there's an assessment task due soon, that's a good thing to mention.}}

- Perhaps give some tips
  {{Fourth, perhaps give some tips.}}
  {{You might highlight things that are particularly tricky this week, or any concepts or techniques that are especially important.}}

- Perhaps provoke some thinking
  {{Fifth, perhaps provoke some thinking.}}
  {{A good way is to challenge them with a question or problem.}}

{{That's our advice about the first key thing you can do - to announce weekly.}}
{{Any questions or comments?}}

# Second key thing:<br>Respond quickly

{{The second key thing you can do to make your presence felt, is to respond quickly, to your students' emails and forum posts.}}
{{This makes a huge difference to them.}}
{{Why is it so important?}}

<img src="ages.png" style="width:auto;height:18em">

{{Here's a chart that shows their ages.}}
{{As you can see, our students are generally older - many of them in their 30s and 40s.}}
{{Most of these have extremely busy lives - working full-time and raising a family, while trying to stay healthy.}}
{{So, they tend to have only small windows of time during which they can study.}}
{{If they encounter a problem during a window, they need to have it resolved quickly. Otherwise, their window might be wasted.}}
{{That's one reason why it's so important for you to respond quickly.}}

# How quickly is quickly?

{{How quickly is quickly?}}

- Ideally, check for queries at least twice per day
  {{Ideally, check for queries at least twice per day, and respond straight away, so that students don't have to wait more than a few hours.}}
  {{You might check, for example, once at 9am, and then again at 5pm.}}

- Including weekends
  {{It's even better if you can do this on weekends too, when many of your students will be studying.}}
  {{If you can achieve these ideals, it will make your teaching easier, and more enjoyable.}}
  {{Think of it as follows.}}
  {{You have to respond sooner or later.}}
  {{If you respond sooner, you'll have happy and appreciative students, who'll cut you slack, if and when you need it.}}
  {{If you respond later, you'll have somewhat frustrated and annoyed students, who'll become increasingly demanding.}}
  {{Each approach takes you the same time, but the first is more enjoyable and rewarding.}}

- At the very least, check once per working day
  {{If you can't achieve these ideals, then at the very least check and respond at least once per working day.}}
  {{If students have to wait longer than that, it can be quite a hindrance to their learning.}}

- Let them know what to expect
  {{Whatever approach you take, it's good to let the students know what to expect, so they can plan accordingly.}}

{{We have more to say about responding to students. But before we go on, any questions or comments about how quickly you should respond?}}

# Tips for responding

{{When it comes to actually responding, there are better and worse ways to do it.}}
{{We have some tips about how you might do the following:}}

- Respond efficiently
  {{Respond efficiently}}

- Respond as a teacher

# Responding efficiently

{{Responding efficiently.}}

{{Responding to students can potentially take a lot of time, so it's good to find ways to do it efficiently.}}
{{Here are some suggestions.}}

- Urge them to search rather than ask
  {{First suggestion: Urge them to search rather than ask.}}
  {{Students can often find what they need by searching the web, or by searching your discussion forum.}}
  {{That saves them having to ask a question, it saves you having to respond, and it saves them having to wait.}}

- Urge them to post rather than email
  {{Second suggestion: Urge them to post rather than email.}}
  {{If their search fails, and they have to ask a question, it's best if they ask it publicly on your discussion forum, rather than privately in an email.}}
  {{That way, everyone gets to benefit from the exchange.}}
  {{Moreover, all going well, no one will need to ask that same question again.}}

- Enable notifications
  {{Third suggestion: Enable notifications.}}
  {{To save you having to manually check, get your discussion forum to send you alerts when questions and comments are posted.}}

- Urge them to answer each other
  {{Fourth suggestion: Urge them to answer each other.}}
  {{It's terrific when a question is answered by another student.}}
  {{First, it's a great learning experience for that student.}}
  {{Second, it saves you time.}}
  {{Third, students can often respond more quickly than we can.}}
  {{And fourth, students can sometimes explain things better, because we forget what it's like to be a beginner.}}
  {{But you should monitor the quality of student responses, and step-in as needed.}}

- Refer to existing posts
  {{Fifth suggestion: Refer to existing posts.}}
  {{If a question has already been answered, it's perfectly fine to just refer to that existing answer.}}

- Use your responses as writing opportunities
  {{Final suggestion: Use your responses as writing opportunities.}}
  {{It can take a long time to write a good response, and it's tempting to cut corners.}}
  {{But that can be false economy - you end up with a response that's not especially illuminating, and might raise more questions than it answers.}}
  {{It's better to spend time getting your response right.}}
  {{Moreover, when you take time to write a good response, you can incorporate it into the course content in future offerings, hopefully eliminating the need for students to ask that question again.}}

{{Those are our suggestions for responding efficiently.}}
{{Any questions or comments?}}

# Responding as a teacher

{{Responding as a teacher.}}

{{Responding quickly is important, but you're also responding as a teacher.}}
{{This means that your responses shouldn't always be immediate and complete.}}

- Sometimes, it's good to wait for other students to respond first
  {{Sometimes, it's good to wait for other students to respond first.}}
  {{As we've already mentioned, this is a great learning opportunity for students.}}

- Sometimes, it's good to leave some gaps to fill
  {{Sometimes, it's good to leave some gaps to fill.}}
  {{It can be better for a student's learning if you just give the start of an answer, or point them in the right direction, and let them fill in the details themselves.}}
  {{So, when should you respond immediately and completely, and when should you not?}}
  {{That's where your expertise as a teacher comes in.}}
  {{You need to judge which approach is best warranted by the circumstances.}}
  {{If a student is frazzled, and a deadline is rapidly approaching, it's probably best to give an immediate and complete response.}}
  {{On the other hand, if a student is asking about some extension material, it might be best to just give them a tip.}}

- Always, read between their lines
  {{No matter how you respond to a student, you should always read between their lines.}}
  {{When students ask questions, they often don't know exactly what question they're asking, or how to ask it.}}
  {{That's not surprising, given that they're grappling with new concepts, and new terminology.}}
  {{So don't automatically answer the question they seem to be asking.}}
  {{Rather, figure out the question that they're trying to ask, or that they should be asking, and answer that question instead.}}
  {{This is another way in which your expertise as a teacher comes in.}}

{{That's our advice about responding as a teacher.}}
{{Any questions or comments?}}

# Responding in a calming manner

{{Responding in a calming manner.}}

{{Students can get a bit on-edge, for all sorts of reasons.}}
{{But you can help to calm them down.}}
{{We have two suggestions.}}

- Be charitable
  {{First suggestion: Be charitable.}}
  {{Sometimes a student might lash-out at your course, in a way that seems unfair.}}
  {{When this happens, it's tempting to get defensive, and to be a little stern with the student.}}
  {{But don't do that.}}
  {{Chances are, the student is upset by something in their personal life, and your course just happens to be their outlet.}}
  {{It's better to let them vent, and to offer a sympathetic ear.}}
  {{When they calm down, they'll probably be apologetic.}}

- Admit your mistakes
  {{Second suggestion: Admit your mistakes.}}
  {{If the student has identified a genuine problem with your course, it's still tempting to get defensive, and to deny or downplay the problem.}}
  {{Again, don't do that.}}
  {{It will just anger the students, and escalate their emotions.}}
  {{It's far better to admit there's a problem, thank the student for identifying it, and do what you can to fix it.}}
  {{Students understand that we make mistakes, and they'll appreciate your honesty and responsiveness.}}

{{Those are our suggestions for how you might respond in a calming manner.}}
{{Any questions or comments?}}

# Going a little further

{{Going a little further}}

{{As we've been discussing, responding quickly is a great way to help your students, and to make them feel cared-for.}}

- Occassionally follow-up

{{It's even better if you occasionally follow-up.}}
{{For example, suppose a student asks how to add colours to a bar chart; you explain; the students says she gets it; and your exchange ends.}}
{{Here's a good thing you might do - a few days later, ask her how she went.}}
{{It's a simple thing, but it can mean a lot to the student. It shows that you're thinking of her, and that you care.}}

{{That's our suggestion for how you might go a little further with your responding.}}
{{Any questions or comments?}}

# Third key thing:<br>Have webinars

{{The third key thing you can do to make your presence felt, is to have webinars.}}
{{If you're the course convenor, you should organise some of these.}}
{{How many webinars should you have?}}

- One for each assessment task
  {{We recommend having a webinar for each assessment task.}}

- Perhaps one every week
  {{Many convenors choose to have a webinar every week, and students appreciate that.}}

{{As for running webinars, here's some advice.}}

- Don't be surprised if not many students attend
  {{First, don't be surprised if not many students attend.}}
  {{No matter what day and time you choose, only some of your students will be free to make it.}}

- Record them
  {{Second, record them.}}
  {{Many of the students who can't attend, will still be keen to watch the webinar later.}}

- Keep them brief
  {{Third, keep them brief.}}
  {{It's good if they're no more than 45 minutes, perhaps an hour at most.}}

- Start with something you've prepared
  {{Fourth, start with something you've prepared.}}
  {{It could be a summary of the main points for the week, or a worked example.}}

- Open up to general questions
  {{Fifth, open up to general questions.}}
  {{Students will often have particular things they'd like to discuss, so give them plenty of opportunity to do so.}}

Webinars are just nice-to-haves
{{Finally, remember that webinars are just nice-to-haves.}}
{{Students should be able to complete the course without attending or watching any webinars.}}
{{So, you shouldn't use them to teach any core material for the first time.}}
{{Think of them as tutorials, rather than as lectures.}}

{{That's our advice about the third key thing you can do - to have webinars.}}
{{Any questions or comments?}}
